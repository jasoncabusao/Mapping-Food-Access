## Summary
***

This report presents a comprehensive geospatial analysis of food access in Washington State and aims to identify and visualize areas where residents face challenges in accessing affordable, nutritious food.

Key components of our analysis include:

1. Mapping of census tracts and counties to visualize population distribution across the state.

2. Identification of low-income and low-access areas at both county and census tract levels.

3. Creation of interactive maps to facilitate exploration of food access issues.

4. A brief case study demonstrating the potential application of our findings for strategic intervention.

Our analysis reveals significant disparities in food access across Washington State, with notable differences between urban and rural areas. We found that low-income neighborhoods often correlate with areas of low food access, highlighting the interconnected nature of economic and food security challenges.

This report provides valuable insights for policymakers, community organizations, and businesses seeking to improve food access. By leveraging geospatial data and visualization techniques, we offer a foundation for evidence-based decision-making and targeted interventions to enhance food security across Washington State. The findings presented here underscore the importance of continued monitoring and analysis of food access issues, as well as the potential for data-driven approaches to address this critical aspect of public health and community well-being.
